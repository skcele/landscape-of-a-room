This Processing program takes in 3D input from a depth sensor and creates a 3D art piece. It organizes raw sensor data into a contour map and works best when objects are within 6 feet.

Use requires a download of Processing from https://processing.org/ and  a 3D camera, preferably Microsoft Kinect for Xbox One with a PC adapter.
